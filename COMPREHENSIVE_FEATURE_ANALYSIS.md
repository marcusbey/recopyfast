## Security Analysis & Recommendations

### Critical Security Vulnerabilities

#### 1. Script Ownership Verification
**Current Risk**: Anyone can embed script on any domain
**Solution**: 
- Domain verification via DNS TXT record or file upload
- Whitelist of authorized domains per site
- Regular domain ownership re-verification

#### 2. Content Injection Attacks
**Current Risk**: No XSS protection for user-generated content
**Solution**:
- Content sanitization before storage and display
- CSP headers for script-based content
- Input validation and output encoding

#### 3. API Abuse Prevention
**Current Risk**: Unlimited API requests possible
**Solution**:
- Per-user rate limiting (Redis-based)
- API key rotation and monitoring
- Suspicious activity detection

#### 4. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Current Risk**: User content not sanitized
**Solution**:
- DOMPurify integration for content cleaning
- Strict CSP policies
- Escape all user-generated content

### Recommended Security Measures

#### Domain Security
```typescript
// Proposed domain verification system
interface SiteVerification {
  domain: string;
  verificationMethod: 'dns' | 'file' | 'meta';
  verificationToken: string;
  verifiedAt: Date | null;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

#### API Security
```typescript
// Rate limiting structure
interface RateLimitConfig {
  tier: 'free' | 'pro' | 'enterprise';
  requestsPerMinute: number;
  dailyLimit: number;
  burstLimit: number;
}
```

#### Content Security
```typescript
// Content validation pipeline
interface ContentSecurity {
  sanitizeHtml: (content: string) => string;
  validateDomain: (domain: string) => boolean;
  checkPermissions: (userId: string, siteId: string) => boolean;
}
```
