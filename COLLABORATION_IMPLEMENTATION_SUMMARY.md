# Collaboration System Implementation Summary

## Overview
The collaboration system for ReCopyFast has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive team collaboration features including invitations, role-based permissions, and real-time collaborative editing.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Database Schema & Types (`supabase/collaboration-schema.sql`, `src/types/index.ts`)

- **Collaboration Notifications**: In-app notification system
- **Team Activity Log**: Comprehensive activity tracking
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Secure multi-tenant data access

### 2. Permission System (`src/lib/collaboration/permissions.ts`)
- **Role Hierarchy**: Viewer < Editor < Manager < Owner
- **Permission Checking**: Team, site, and content-level permission validation
- **Session Management**: Content editing session lifecycle management
- **Conflict Detection**: Multi-user editing conflict prevention

### 3. API Endpoints

#### Team Management
- `POST /api/teams` - Create new team
- `GET /api/teams` - List user's teams
- `GET /api/teams/[teamId]/members` - List team members
- `PATCH /api/teams/[teamId]/members` - Update member roles
- `DELETE /api/teams/[teamId]/members` - Remove team members

#### Invitation System

#### Site Sharing
- `POST /api/sites/[siteId]/share` - Share site with users/teams
- `GET /api/sites/[siteId]/share` - List site permissions
- `DELETE /api/sites/[siteId]/share` - Revoke site access

#### Notifications & Activity
- `GET /api/notifications` - Get user notifications
- `PATCH /api/notifications` - Mark notifications as read/unread
- `GET /api/teams/[teamId]/activity` - Get team activity log

### 4. Real-time Collaboration (`src/lib/collaboration/realtime.ts`)
- **Socket.io Integration**: WebSocket connection management
- **Presence Tracking**: Real-time user presence and activity
- **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time content synchronization
- **Cursor Positions**: Live cursor and selection tracking
- **Edit Sessions**: Session-based editing with conflict prevention
- **Auto-reconnection**: Robust connection handling

### 5. UI Components

#### Team Management (`src/components/collaboration/`)
- **TeamDashboard**: Complete team management interface
  - Member list with role indicators
  - Invitation management for managers/owners
  - Activity feed and team settings
  - Role-based feature gating
- **TeamSelector**: Team switching and creation interface
- **InvitationManager**: Invitation acceptance and management

#### Real-time Features
- **CollaborativeEditor**: Real-time collaborative text editing
  - Permission-based editing controls
  - Live presence indicators
  - Conflict resolution UI
  - Edit session management
- **PresenceIndicator**: Online user tracking
  - User avatars and activity status
  - Detailed presence information
  - Cursor position indicators

#### Notifications
- **NotificationCenter**: Collaboration notification management
  - Real-time notification display
  - Mark as read/unread functionality
  - Notification type categorization
- **NotificationBell**: Header notification indicator

### 6. Permission Levels

#### Team Roles
- **Viewer**: Can view team content and activity
- **Editor**: Can edit assigned content sections
- **Manager**: Can edit all content, invite members, manage team
- **Owner**: Full control including billing and team deletion

#### Site Permissions
- Site-level permissions can be granted to individual users or entire teams
- Inherited permissions through team membership
- Granular content section permissions

### 7. Testing (`src/__tests__/collaboration/`)
- **Unit Tests**: Permission system and real-time functionality
- **API Tests**: Team management endpoint testing
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and user flows
- **Mocking**: Proper mocking of external dependencies

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication integration
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Permission checking middleware for all protected endpoints
- Session token validation for editing sessions

### Data Privacy
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- User can only access teams they belong to
- Site permissions properly enforced
- Activity logging for audit trails

### Real-time Security
- Socket.io authentication via JWT tokens
- Room-based isolation (site-specific channels)
- Permission validation for all real-time operations
- Session token validation for editing rights

## Integration Points

### Existing Systems
- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing Supabase auth
- **Database**: Extends existing schema with collaboration tables
- **UI Components**: Uses existing design system components
- **API Patterns**: Follows established API conventions

### External Dependencies
- **Socket.io**: Real-time communication
- **Supabase**: Database and authentication
- **React**: UI framework integration
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration
- Run `collaboration-schema.sql` against Supabase database
- Update RLS policies for existing tables
- Verify foreign key constraints

### Real-time Server
- Deploy Socket.io server alongside Next.js application
- Configure WebSocket proxy in production
- Set up proper CORS and authentication

### Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-websocket-server.com
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Team
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/teams', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'My Team',
    description: 'Team description'
  })
});
```

### Inviting a Member
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`/api/teams/${teamId}/invitations`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    role: 'editor'
  })
});
```

### Real-time Collaboration
```typescript
import { collaborationRealtime } from '@/lib/collaboration/realtime';

// Connect to collaboration
await collaborationRealtime.connect(siteId, authToken);

// Start editing session
await collaborationRealtime.startEditingSession(elementId, sessionToken);

// Send collaborative edits
collaborationRealtime.sendEdit(content, delta);
```

## Future Enhancements

### Email Integration
