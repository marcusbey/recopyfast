# Test Quality Review Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures consistent quality across all test implementations in the RecopyFast codebase. Use this during code reviews, test audits, and when writing new tests.

## Pre-Review Preparation

### Automated Checks
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No console errors or warnings during test execution
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] ESLint passes with no test-related violations
- [ ] Code coverage meets minimum thresholds (80%)

### Test Execution
- [ ] Tests run in isolation (can be run individually)
- [ ] Tests run consistently (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Test suite completes within reasonable time (<5 minutes for full suite)

## Code Quality Review

### Test Structure and Organization

#### File Organization
- [ ] Test files are co-located with source files (`__tests__/` directory)
- [ ] Test files follow naming convention (`*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`)
- [ ] Tests are logically grouped using `describe` blocks
- [ ] Test descriptions clearly indicate what is being tested

#### Test Structure
- [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- [ ] Each test has a single, clear responsibility
- [ ] Test names are descriptive and meaningful
- [ ] Setup and teardown are properly handled

```typescript
// ✅ Good test structure
describe('UserService', () => {
  describe('createUser', () => {
    it('should create user with valid data and return user ID', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test User' };
      mockDatabase.insert.mockResolvedValue({ id: 'user-123' });

      // Act
      const result = await userService.createUser(userData);

      // Assert
      expect(result.success).toBe(true);
      expect(result.userId).toBe('user-123');
    });
  });
});
```

### Mocking and Dependencies

#### Mock Quality
- [ ] External dependencies are properly mocked
- [ ] Mocks are realistic and maintain interface contracts
- [ ] Mock setup is done at appropriate scope (module, test, or describe block)
- [ ] Mocks are cleared/reset between tests

#### Mock Implementation
- [ ] Supabase mocks properly chain methods
- [ ] API mocks return realistic data structures
- [ ] Error scenarios are properly mocked
- [ ] Async operations are correctly mocked

```typescript
// ✅ Good Supabase mock
const mockSupabase = {
  from: jest.fn(() => mockSupabase),
  select: jest.fn(() => mockSupabase),
  eq: jest.fn(() => mockSupabase),
  single: jest.fn(),
  insert: jest.fn(() => mockSupabase),
  update: jest.fn(() => mockSupabase),
  upsert: jest.fn(),
};

// ✅ Good method chaining mock
mockSupabase.eq
  .mockReturnValueOnce(mockSupabase) // first eq()
  .mockReturnValueOnce(mockSupabase) // second eq()
  .mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: mockData, error: null }); // final result
```

### Component Testing Quality

#### React Testing Library Best Practices
- [ ] Uses accessibility-focused queries (`getByRole`, `getByLabelText`)
- [ ] Avoids testing implementation details
- [ ] Tests user interactions with `userEvent`
- [ ] Properly handles async operations with `waitFor`

#### Component Coverage
- [ ] Tests rendering with default props
- [ ] Tests all significant prop variations
- [ ] Tests user interaction handlers
- [ ] Tests conditional rendering logic
- [ ] Tests error states and loading states

```typescript
// ✅ Good component test
describe('SearchInput', () => {
  it('should call onSearch when user submits form', async () => {
    const mockOnSearch = jest.fn();
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    
    render(<SearchInput onSearch={mockOnSearch} />);
    
    const input = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /search/i });
    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /search/i });
    
    await user.type(input, 'test query');
    await user.click(submitButton);
    
    expect(mockOnSearch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test query');
  });
});
```

### API Testing Quality

#### Route Handler Tests
- [ ] Tests all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Tests successful responses with correct status codes
- [ ] Tests error scenarios with appropriate error codes
- [ ] Tests request validation
- [ ] Tests database interactions

#### Database Testing
- [ ] Database mocks properly simulate real behavior
- [ ] Error conditions are tested (connection failures, constraint violations)
- [ ] Transaction handling is tested where applicable
- [ ] Data persistence is verified

```typescript
// ✅ Good API test
describe('/api/users', () => {
  describe('POST', () => {
    it('should create user and return 201', async () => {
      mockSupabase.eq
        .mockReturnValueOnce(mockSupabase)
        .mockResolvedValueOnce({ data: null, error: null }); // user doesn't exist
      mockSupabase.insert.mockResolvedValueOnce({ 
        data: { id: 'user-123' }, 
        error: null 
      });

      const request = new NextRequest('/api/users', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'test@example.com' })
      });

      const response = await POST(request);
      const data = await response.json();

      expect(response.status).toBe(201);
      expect(data.userId).toBe('user-123');
    });
  });
});
```

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Quantitative Coverage

- [ ] Security-sensitive operations are tested

### Coverage Gaps
- [ ] Identify untested code paths
- [ ] Verify intentional exclusions (e.g., configuration files)
- [ ] No test coverage for trivial getters/setters only

## Performance and Efficiency

### Test Performance

- [ ] No unnecessary async operations
- [ ] Database operations are mocked appropriately
- [ ] Network requests are mocked

### Resource Usage
- [ ] Tests clean up after themselves
- [ ] No memory leaks in long-running test suites
- [ ] Mock timers are used for time-dependent tests
- [ ] File system operations are mocked

```typescript
// ✅ Good performance practices
describe('TimerComponent', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.useFakeTimers();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.useRealTimers();
  });

  it('should update display after timeout', () => {
    render(<TimerComponent />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText('0 seconds')).toBeInTheDocument();
    
    act(() => {
      jest.advanceTimersByTime(1000);
    });
    
    expect(screen.getByText('1 seconds')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network failures are tested
- [ ] Database errors are handled
- [ ] Validation errors are properly tested
- [ ] Authentication/authorization failures are covered

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty/null inputs
- [ ] Boundary values (min/max)
- [ ] Concurrent operations
- [ ] Race conditions

### User Input Validation
- [ ] Invalid data formats
- [ ] Missing required fields
- [ ] Data that exceeds limits
- [ ] Special characters and encoding

```typescript
// ✅ Good error testing
describe('validateEmail', () => {
  it.each([
    ['', 'Email is required'],
    ['invalid-email', 'Email format is invalid'],
    ['user@', 'Email domain is invalid'],
    ['@domain.com', 'Email user is invalid'],
  ])('should reject invalid email "%s" with message "%s"', (email, expectedError) => {
    const result = validateEmail(email);
    expect(result.isValid).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toBe(expectedError);
